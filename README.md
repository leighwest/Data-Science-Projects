# Data Science Projects
A portfolio of my data science projects 

## Contents
* Python
  * [NYC SAT Scores](https://github.com/leighwest/Data-Science-NYC-SAT-Scores/blob/master/NYC%20SAT%20Scores.ipynb): Cleaning and analysis of demographic and outcome data of New York City students' SAT scores.
  * [NYC Car Accidents](https://github.com/leighwest/Data-Science-Exit-Survey/blob/master/NYC%20Car%20Accidents.ipynb): Analysis of motor vehicle collision data released by New York City.
  * [Exit Survey Analysis](https://github.com/leighwest/Data-Science-Exit-Survey/blob/master/Exit%20Survey.ipynb): Evaluates whether particular demographics of employees at the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and Queensland TAFE are likely to resign due to dissatisfaction.

* SQL
  * [Querying an Online Record Store](https://github.com/leighwest/SQL-Querying-Demo/blob/master/Chinook.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook of complex SQL queries with a Python front end which queries the popular Chinook online record store database.  An image file of the scheme diagram is available [here](https://github.com/leighwest/SQL-Querying-Demo/blob/master/Schema.PNG).
  
* R
  * In this report I utilised R to build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict mean life expectancy based on country level demographic data.  A link to the report is available [here](https://github.com/leighwest/Predicting-Life-Expectancy-from-Demographic-Factors/blob/master/Predicting%20Mean%20Life%20Expectancy%20from%20Demographic%20Factors.pdf). If you wish to view the main R code it's available [here](https://github.com/leighwest/Predicting-Life-Expectancy-from-Demographic-Factors/blob/master/Life%20Expectancy%20code.R) and supplementary code is available [here](https://github.com/leighwest/Predicting-Life-Expectancy-from-Demographic-Factors/blob/master/Rfunctions.R).
